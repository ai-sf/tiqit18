info: "The Trento-Innsbruck Quantum Information Tour will take place from the 10th to the 13th of april. The event will start in Trento with the visit to the university and the BEC and nanosciences labs. Then participants will meet at the bus station in order to take the bus to Innsbruck for the IQOQI visit. At the end of the day we will stay in an hostel in Innsbruck center for the night and the following day there will be the visit to the Innsbruck university, at the end of which is organized a lunch and then the return to Trento, again by bus.
 The event will have a focus on Bose-Einstein Condensation, Nanoscience, Quantum
